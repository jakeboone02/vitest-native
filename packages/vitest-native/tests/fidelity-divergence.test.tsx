/**
 * Mock-engine divergence tests — the OTHER half of the differential pair with
 * `tests-native/fidelity.test.tsx`.
 *
 * These run under the default (mock) engine and assert the mock's ACTUAL behavior,
 * which diverges from real React Native. Each `it` documents a place where a test
 * written against the mock would give a FALSE PASS relative to a real device — i.e.
 * the concrete reason to reach for `engine: 'native'` when fidelity matters.
 *
 * If one of these starts failing because the mock was improved to match real RN,
 * that's good — update it (and the native counterpart) to reflect the new parity.
