# vitest-native

## 0.4.0

**The native engine is now the zero-config default.** `reactNative()` with no
options runs your tests against **real React Native** — the same JavaScript that
ships in your app — mocking only the native-module boundary. The pure-JS mock
engine remains as an explicit opt-in (`engine: 'mock'`). vitest-native positions
itself as the maintained continuation of
[`vitest-community/vitest-react-native`](https://github.com/vitest-community/vitest-react-native).

> Beta. The native engine is validated against real apps (react-native-paper, the
> obytes template, Rocket.Chat) across React Native 0.81–0.84, with a CI-gated
> behavioral cross-check against real RN. Some APIs may still shift before 1.0.

### Breaking Changes

- **`engine: 'auto'` (the default) now resolves to `'native'`** whenever
  `@react-native/babel-preset` and `@babel/core` are present — i.e. in any real RN
  app. It falls back to `'mock'` only when those deps are absent, printing one line
  to explain why. Previously `auto` always resolved to `mock`. Set
  `engine: 'mock'` to keep the old behavior.

### Native engine

- **Boundary hardening.** The native-module stub now honors RN's calling
  conventions it previously broke: callback-style methods invoke the success
  callback instead of hanging (fixes `AccessibilityInfo.*`, `Share.share`), and
  promise-returning methods return a real `Promise` (fixes `Linking.canOpenURL`/
  `openURL`, `Image.prefetch`/`getSize`). Backed by app-shaped stress suites
  (`tests-native/stress*.test.tsx`) as a permanent regression gate.
- **`isolate: true` is the native-engine default** — the safe Vitest default.
  Adversarial testing proved `isolate: false` leaks state across files at scale.
  An opt-in **hot runtime** (`reactNative({ hotRuntime: true })`) reclaims the
  speed safely via surgical per-file reset, for large suites.
- **`transform` allowlist** — extra `node_modules` packages whose untranspiled
  source the native engine should strip (Flow/TS/JSX) as it loads them, for
  third-party RN libraries (analogous to Jest's `transformIgnorePatterns`).
- **Presets apply under the native engine**, shadowing each library's native
  runtime (worklets, native modules) the way Jest does — including transitively
  imported presets — while the surrounding tree renders through real RN.
- **Expo**: the `expo` preset shadows the common Expo modules under the native
  engine (gated proof in `tests-native/expo.test.tsx`).

### Trust & tooling

- **Cross-check** — a CI-gated behavioral differential that runs the same probes
  under `mock` and `native` and diffs them against real RN as the oracle. It is
  how mock fidelity is proven (and it found two of the mock fixes below).
- **Vitest × RN CI matrix** — gates the native engine across RN 0.81–0.84 ×
  Vitest {pinned, latest}, with the latest-Vitest column as a non-blocking canary.
- **Jest migration tooling** — a `vitest-native/jest-compat` entry (the `jest`
  global, `@jest/globals`, jest-native extend-expect) plus auto-hoisting of
  top-level `jest.mock` → `vi.mock` and automatic JSX runtime. Guides:
  `docs/migrating-from-jest.md` and `docs/migrating-from-vitest-react-native.md`.

### Presets & matchers

- `react-native-gesture-handler` preset now exports `Pressable` (mirroring RN's,
  including suppressing press handlers when `disabled`).
- `toHaveAnimatedStyle` / `toHaveAnimatedProps` are auto-registered on `expect()`,
  replacing reanimated's Jest-only `setUpTests()` matchers. Opt into types with
  `"types": ["vitest-native/matchers"]`.
- New presets: `react-native-device-info`, `react-native-mmkv`, `react-native-svg`,
  `react-native-webview`; navigation preset covers drawer/bottom-tabs/elements.

### Mock-engine fidelity fixes

- Disabled `Pressable`/`Touchable` mocks now suppress press handlers.
- `StyleSheet.hairlineWidth` is derived from the pixel ratio (≈`1/3` at scale 3)
  instead of a hardcoded `0.5`, matching real RN.
- `Animated.Value.interpolate()` supports string output ranges (e.g.
  `["0deg", "360deg"]`, `["0%", "100%"]`), preserving the unit/suffix.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Add RN conformance test suite — 75 tests ported from React Native's own test suite (Animated, processColor, flattenStyle, Interpolation) to validate mock behavioral parity
- Add Animated orchestration: `sequence` chains via callbacks, `parallel` waits for all, `loop` supports finite/indefinite iterations with `resetBeforeIteration`
- Add Animated value tracking: `timing`/`spring` with an `AnimatedValue` as `toValue` track source changes via listener
- Add Animated.Color, diffClamp tracking, interpolation extrapolate/easing, toJSON support
- Expand reanimated preset: 44 entering/exiting animations, 7 layout transitions, `useAnimatedReaction`, `useAnimatedKeyboard`, `useReducedMotion`, `useFrameCallback`, `makeMutable`, `SharedTransition`, `ReduceMotion`/`KeyboardState` enums
- Add `@react-navigation/drawer` preset with `createDrawerNavigator`
- Add `setInsets()` helper for safe area context testing
- Add inter-test isolation: `resetAllMocks()` now resets AsyncStorage store and safe area insets
- 1136 tests passing across 30 files

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Add missing `@react-navigation/core` re-exports to navigation preset, including `useNavigationContainerRef`, `useTheme`, `ThemeProvider`, `NavigationIndependentTree`, `useNavigationBuilder`, `BaseRouter`, and 20+ other exports. Fixes tests that depend on these being available from `@react-navigation/native`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add Metro-compatible extensionless module resolution for node_modules. Add navigation preset mocks for @react-navigation/native-stack, @react-navigation/bottom-tabs, and @react-navigation/elements. Support custom presets.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 260ae84: Fix package metadata: correct GitHub URLs and Node >= 20 engine requirement.
