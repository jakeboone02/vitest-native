# Migrating from `vitest-react-native`

If you used [`vitest-community/vitest-react-native`](https://github.com/vitest-community/vitest-react-native)
and it stopped working on a newer Vitest, this is the continuation you're looking for.

**The short version:** it's the same idea, maintained. The original plugin and
`vitest-native`'s default engine share the same architecture — externalize React
Native to Node, strip its Flow types through a require hook, and mock only the
thin native boundary (`View`/`Text`/`UIManager`/`NativeModules`/…). The original
simply went unmaintained through Vitest's module-runner rewrites (v2 → v3 → v4)
and bit-rotted. `vitest-native` tracks current Vitest and React Native, and a CI
matrix gates it across both so it stays alive.

For the common case — render real RN with RNTL, mock your *own* modules with
`vi.mock` — migration is a config swap.

---

## 1. Swap the package

```bash
# remove the old plugin
npm rm vitest-react-native @vitejs/plugin-react

# add this one (+ the babel preset it uses to strip RN's Flow types)
npm i -D vitest-native @react-native/babel-preset @babel/core
```

Keep your existing `vitest`, `vite`, `react`, `react-native`, and
`@testing-library/react-native`. Requirements: **Vitest ≥ 4, Vite ≥ 5, React 19,
React Native 0.81–0.84 (validated), RNTL ≥ 12.**

## 2. Update `vitest.config`

**Before** (`vitest-react-native`):

```ts
import reactNative from 'vitest-react-native';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [reactNative(), react()],
});
```

**After** (`vitest-native`):

```ts
import { reactNative } from 'vitest-native';
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [reactNative()],
});
```

Two changes:

- **Named import** — `import { reactNative }`, not a default import.
- **Drop `@vitejs/plugin-react`** — `vitest-native` configures the JSX runtime
  itself (both engines). Adding `plugin-react` alongside it is unnecessary and
  can double-transform.

That's it. `reactNative()` with no options resolves to the **native engine** (real
RN) whenever `@react-native/babel-preset` is installed, which it now is.

## 3. Run

```bash
npx vitest run
```

Your existing tests render against real React Native exactly as before.

---

## What's the same

- Real RN component rendering via `@testing-library/react-native`.
- `vi.mock()` of **your own** modules (anything in your app's source graph).
- Standard Vitest everything — `expect`, `vi.fn`, coverage, watch, UI.

## What's new (and optional)

- **Native is the zero-config default**, but a fast **mock engine** is one option
  away — `reactNative({ engine: 'mock' })` — for pure-logic and environment-control
  tests. A CI-gated cross-check keeps the mock behaviorally honest against real RN.
- **Presets** auto-shadow common native libraries (Reanimated, Gesture Handler,
  Safe Area, Navigation, …) the way `jest` mocks them — no per-lib wiring.
- An opt-in **hot runtime** (`reactNative({ hotRuntime: true })`) keeps RN warm
  across files for large suites.

## Gotchas (the margins)

These are inherent to running RN externalized to Node — they applied to the
original plugin too:

- **`vi.mock` of an externalized RN-side library may not intercept.** Libraries
  that load through Node (not your Vite source graph) bypass Vitest's mocker.
  Prefer a **preset** (if one exists) or mock at the boundary. Your *own* modules
  mock normally.
- **Custom Babel plugins don't run.** Transforms go through Vite/esbuild, not your
  `babel.config.js`. Flow/TS stripping for RN and allow-listed packages is handled
  by the require hook; use the `transform` allowlist for extra pure-JS packages
  that ship untranspiled source.

If something that worked under the old plugin doesn't here, open an issue — parity
with `vitest-react-native` is a goal, and the cross-check corpus is how we prove it.
