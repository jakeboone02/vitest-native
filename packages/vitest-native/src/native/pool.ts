// Custom Vitest pool for the native engine's hot runtime.
//
// Wraps Vitest's stock ThreadsPoolWorker, changing exactly one thing: the
// worker entrypoint (worker.mjs, which flips config.isolate back on inside the
// worker — see worker.mjs for the full picture). Scheduling-wise this pool runs
// under isolate:false, the only mode where Vitest keeps workers alive across
// files (and the only mode where `canReuse` is consulted), so `canReuse` doubles
// as the worker-recycling policy hook for leak self-defense.
//
// Recycling contract (verified in vitest 4.0.18 Pool source): after every task,
// the scheduler checks `isEqualRunner(runner, nextTask)` — which defers to our
// `canReuse` — and a declined runner is stopped immediately (termination is
// started right away, awaited at the end of the run). So returning false here
// retires the worker; it does NOT leak an idle thread.
//
// Memory-based recycling rides Vitest's own reporting rails: `reportMemory`
// makes the worker include `memoryUsage().heapUsed` in every testfileFinished
// response. (Vitest's config-level `memoryLimit` is hardcoded to the vm pools —
// custom pools can't receive task.memoryLimit — so the threshold is our own
// option. Upstream RFC item.)
