/**
 * Expo proof: a component that imports common Expo modules renders under the
 * native engine. The `expo` preset (auto-detected via expo-constants) shadows
 * each Expo module the way jest-expo mocks them, so their native runtime never
 * loads — while the surrounding tree renders through REAL React Native.
 *
 * expo-constants + expo-status-bar are installed as devDependencies so this
 * proves auto-detection + correct shadowing, mirroring third-party-stack.test.tsx.
 *
 * Scope note: Expo modules WITHOUT a built-in preset still need a vi.mock or a
 * custom preset (exactly as jest-expo provides mocks for them). This probe
 * covers the presets we ship, not the entire Expo SDK.
